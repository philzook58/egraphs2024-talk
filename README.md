Automated reasoning is an established field with a long history and many ideas. E-graph rewriting techniques fits into this history. This connection suggests roads to implementing fundamental extensions to e-graph rewriting.

- Union Finds are Atomic Ground Completion
- E-Graphs are Ground Completion
- Ground Superposition is a contextual E-graph
- Lambda superposition holds clues / is a lambda e-graph
- Completion is an E-Graph with unification variables / first class rules

Twee, Vampire, E-prover, and Zipperposition are capable of doing the same thing as egg if they supported the right interfaces.
